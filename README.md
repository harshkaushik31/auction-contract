# Decentralized Online Auction Platform

## Project Title
**Decentralized Online Auction Platform**

## Project Description
A blockchain-based platform that enables transparent, secure, and trustless auctions using smart contracts to manage bids and declare winners automatically. This platform leverages the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts to ensure that all auction processes are immutable, transparent, and free from intermediary manipulation. Sellers can create auctions for their items, buyers can place competitive bids, and winners are declared automatically when the auction period ends.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the auction industry by eliminating centralized control and providing a truly decentralized marketplace where:
- **Transparency** is guaranteed through blockchain technology
- **Trust** is built into the system through smart contracts
- **Fairness** is ensured as all bids are publicly verifiable
- **Security** protects both buyers and sellers from fraud
- **Efficiency** is achieved through automated winner declaration and settlement

We aim to create a global auction platform accessible to anyone with an internet connection, where participants from different countries can engage in secure transactions without worrying about payment fraud, bid manipulation, or unfair practices.
